## Auto Show

Make a dummy car enthusiast website that involves the following:
1. Have the capability for a user to sign-up and sign-in (username-password is fine, OAuth would be a +);
2. Able to update their entry. An entry involves the following; car make, model, year, a few images of the car, and a map location for a showroom location where they take their car on weekends to display
3. Ability to view other user's entries (all the details in (2) above except if the user is not logged-in, in which case they'll see the car details with a limited number of images â€” like 2, and they cannot see the location of the showroom).
4. Have a chatting feature within the app that users can talk to each other.
